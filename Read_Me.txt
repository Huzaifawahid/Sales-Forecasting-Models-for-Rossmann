1.Project Title:
Processing of a Sales Forecasting Model for Rossman

2. Description:
This project aims to predict six weeks of daily sales for 1,115 retail outlets of the Rossman drug store chain in Germany. Using historical sales data, we developed a time series machine learning model to understand the factors affecting sales, optimizing forecasting accuracy and analytical value.

4. Prerequisites:
	Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

	1. **Python**:
  	 - Install Python 3.7 or higher. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

	2. **Package Manager**:
   	- Make sure `pip` is installed. 
    	
	3. **Libraries and Dependencies**:
   	- Install the required Python libraries. Run the following command to install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
    	 ```sh
     	pip install -r requirements.txt
     	```
   	- The main libraries used in this project are:
    		- `numpy`
     		- `pandas`
     		- `scikit-learn`
    		- `xgboost`
     		- `matplotlib`
    		- `seaborn`
     		- `scipy`
     		- `joblib`

	4. **Development Environment**:
 	  - Use an IDE or text editor such as PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook for a better development experience.

	5. **Version Control System**:
  	 - Install `git` for cloning the repository and version control. You can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

5. Usage
	To run the model, ensure that all the notebooks and datasets are located in the same directory.

7.Additional Information
	-The processing of the Sales Forecasting Gradient Model.ipynb file involves importing necessary libraries, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, design, training, testing, 	 and evaluation of the gradient model.
	-Processing of a Sales Forecasting MLP & Random Forest Model .ipynb includes design, training, testing,and evaluation of the MLP and Random Forest model
	- The Sales Dashboard.ipynb file offers visualization and analysis of sales data, providing insights into individual store sales and a comparision to others.In Sales Dashboard you 	need to write the Store ID you want to look into the sales of.
